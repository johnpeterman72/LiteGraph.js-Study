# Notes on LiteGraph.js Node Creation Tools

## Current State of Editors for LiteGraph.js Node Creation

Based on our research, there are currently no specialized visual editors or wizards specifically designed for creating custom node types in LiteGraph.js. The node creation process is primarily code-based, with developers using standard development environments.

### Typical Workflow

1. Write JavaScript code in standard IDEs (VS Code, WebStorm, etc.)
2. Define node constructor functions and prototype methods
3. Register the nodes with the LiteGraph system
4. Test them in the LiteGraph editor
5. Iterate based on results

### Potential Tools That Could Be Adapted

While no dedicated tools exist, several existing platforms could potentially be modified to facilitate LiteGraph.js node creation:

1. **LiteGraph's own editor**: Could be extended with a code generation panel that scaffolds new node types based on templates.

2. **Block-based coding environments**: Tools like Google's Blockly or MIT's Scratch could potentially be modified to generate LiteGraph node code.

3. **Visual code generators**: Form-based interfaces using tools like Rjsf (React JSON Schema Form) could generate node code based on user inputs.

4. **Node-RED editor**: Its UI concepts for creating flow-based programming nodes might be adaptable, though the architecture differs.

5. **Specialized IDE extensions**: Custom extensions for Visual Studio Code could provide snippets, templates, and wizards.

6. **Interactive documentation tools**: Tools like Storybook could be adapted to showcase node components and enable interactive experimentation with code generation.

## Development Opportunity

Creating a simple web-based wizard that guides users through the node creation process would be a valuable contribution to the LiteGraph.js ecosystem. Such a tool could:

- Provide a form-based interface for defining inputs, outputs, properties
- Offer selection of widget types with configuration options
- Generate boilerplate code for common node behaviors
- Include a live preview of the resulting node
- Export ready-to-use node code

This would significantly lower the barrier to entry for creating custom nodes and potentially expand the LiteGraph.js user base.
