## Introduction

LiteGraph.js is a JavaScript library for creating node-based graphs with a visual editor, similar to Unreal Blueprints or Pure Data. This project focuses specifically on creating custom nodes with interactive controls (widgets), an essential aspect for building sophisticated node-based applications.

## Key Features

This research covers:

1. Built-in widget types and their usage
2. Creating custom interactive controls
3. Handling mouse interactions for custom widgets
4. Data visualization within nodes
5. Event-based interactions between nodes
6. Best practices for node design and implementation

## Examples Included

The repository includes several complete examples demonstrating different widget types and interaction patterns:

- Basic widgets (number, slider, combo, toggle, button)
- Custom interactive elements (buttons, knobs, graphs)
- Data visualization techniques
- Event handling and triggering

## Getting Started

To use these examples in your own LiteGraph.js project:

1. Review the [research-summary.md](research-summary.md) for an overview
2. Study the [custom-nodes-guide.md](custom-nodes-guide.md) for implementation details
3. Copy code from [custom-widget-examples.js](custom-widget-examples.js) as needed
4. Uncomment the node registration lines to make them available in your graph editor
